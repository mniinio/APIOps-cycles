# APIOps&reg; Cycles

## What is this?

The APIOps&reg; Cycles is a set of tools and methods for designing **API Management compatible API's with Clear business orientation and best practice architecture patters**.

APIOps&reg; method uses modern and proven frameworks with a twist of our experience to the them for APIs. All methods have a Lean management base: [DevOps (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), [Business Model Canvas (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas), [Value Proposition Canvas](), [Lean Startup (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup), [Minimum Viable Architecture](https://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/116163/minimum-viable-architecture-good-enough-good-enough-enterprise/) and [API Model Canvas](https://www.slideshare.net/3scale/api-model-canvas-apidays-mediterranea-2015). Afore mentioned frameworks, tools and methods have been re-interpreted to create the APIOps&reg; Cycles. 

APIOps&reg; Cycles is created in collaboration with open non-profit [APIOps.net Community](https://medium.com/apiops) and [Digia Plc](www.digia.com).

## How do you use

The APIOps&reg; Cycles model can be used in various ways. Here's a few obvious examples: 

* Use the model to help customers with entering API economy and adopt standardized processes in API development and maintenance to maximise results and to minimize costs. 
* Use the model in API management and alike tool development as a process model.

## How do you report issues

Before submitting new issue, please check out the previous issues in case your topic has alredy been started by someone else. If you can't find any similat issue, begin a new one. A good issue normally takes the following into account: 

**Context: explain the conditions which led you to write this issue.**

For example: “Since we’ve tried the model with a few cases, we could not find a solution to this.”

**Problem or idea: the context should lead to something, an idea or a problem that you’re facing.**

For example: “We’ve had no way of easily seeing the performance impact before releasing our changes to production.”

**Solution or next step: this where you move forward.** 

You can engage others (request feedback), assign somebody else to the issue, or simply leave it for further investigation, but you absolutely need to propose a next step towards solving the issue.

A few more things: 

* Keep titles short and descriptive. 
* Remain clear and concise. 
* Include the right people in your discussion. 
* Format your messages. 
* Add links to you references.
